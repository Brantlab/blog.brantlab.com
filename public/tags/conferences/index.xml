      <description>How was it? The Conference was different from years past even if the design and marketing around the venue was reused. It was the same footprint, but the expo hall definitely seemed to lack a lot of familiar faces. Even in general attendance I definitliy missed a lot of faces that you have seen in many years passed. I went back and reviewed the general session on information regarding attendance and did not find anything in the re-watch.</description>

      <title>Attending Powershell Summit as a sysadmin</title>

      <description>What did I get into? I use Powershell day in and day out in my daily role. This conference made a lot of sense to attend but what I didnâ€™t realize is I am more of a utility scripter and the conference had a big DevOps focus this year but that is how Powershell is heading as a whole. This mindset is a change for me and how I use my scripts by focusing more on reusable code such as functions and parameters vs hard coding information.</description>
