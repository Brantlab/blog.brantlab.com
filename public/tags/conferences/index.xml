      <description>What did I get into? I use Powershell day in and day out in my daily role. This conference made a lot of sense to attend but what I didnâ€™t realize is I am more of a utility scripter and the conference had a big DevOps focus this year but that is how Powershell is heading as a whole. This mindset is a change for me and how I use my scripts by focusing more on reusable code such as functions and parameters vs hard coding information.</description>
