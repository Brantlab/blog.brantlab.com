      <description>Back in the saddle On April 19th I gave a presentation to Fort Wayne VMUG around N8N and my current escapades down that rabbit hole of an automation framework. I have a DevOps mindset but wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure where I was going with this application other than some specific use cases which I will discuss later in this article. Let&amp;rsquo;s jump into the &amp;ldquo;What is it?&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;What is it? n8n is an open-source workflow automation tool that allows users to connect different apps and services together to automate tasks and processes without any coding.</description>

      <description>Why? Our VMUG did not have a presenter lined up, so I figured it was time to pay my “dues” so to speak. I came up with the idea of covering #BackToTheBasics inside of VMWare pertaining to performance, Which included vNuma, ESXTOP, and snapshots. Which I have found have been heavy-hitting performance issues in my environments. This seemed like a great time to brush up on my first presentation since high school that wasn&amp;rsquo;t me blabbering and rambling through 5-10 mins of how-tos for a group of people.</description>
